## 🔁 Task Workflow

1. **Admin assigns a task** to a user
2. **User sees the task**, marks it as In Progress
3. **User submits task** → Admin reviews and either **approves or rejects**
4. **Rejected tasks** can be **reworked** and resubmitted by the user

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed.
